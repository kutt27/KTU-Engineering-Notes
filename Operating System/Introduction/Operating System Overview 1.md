### What is an Operating System?
---
An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and  the computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an  environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient  manner. An operating system is a software that manages the computer hardware.

The purpose of the design of each operating system varies. Some operating  systems are designed to be convenient, others to be efficient, and others to be  some combination of the two.

**Resource allocator**

The resource allocator is responsible for allocating resources to the different programs running on the computer. This includes CPU time, memory, and storage. The resource allocator ensures that all programs have access to the resources they need, but it also prevents any one program from hogging all the resources and preventing other programs from running.

**Control program**

The control program is responsible for scheduling the execution of the different programs. This means that the control program decides which program will run next, and for how long. The control program also ensures that all programs run in a safe and orderly manner.

**Kernel**

The kernel is the core of the operating system. It is responsible for managing the hardware resources of the computer, such as the CPU, memory, and storage. The kernel also provides basic services to the other parts of the operating system, such as process management, memory management, and file management.

**Middleware**

Middleware is software that sits between the operating system and the application programs. It provides services such as networking, security, and database access. Middleware helps to make it easier for application programs to interact with each other and with the operating system.
