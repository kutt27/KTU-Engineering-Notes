### Some questions:

Problem: Explain the concept of interrupts and how they are used for accessing I/O devices. Provide an example scenario where interrupts are beneficial.

Problem: Describe the components of interrupt hardware and their functions. How do interrupt controllers handle multiple interrupts?

Problem: Explain the concept of direct memory access (DMA) and its advantages over programmed I/O. Compare and contrast DMA and interrupt-driven I/O.

Problem: Discuss the basic concepts of semiconductor RAMs (Random Access Memories) used in memory systems. Describe the structure and organization of a typical RAM chip.

Problem: Explain the role of ROMs (Read-Only Memories) in memory systems. Discuss the types of ROMs and their specific characteristics.

Problem: Discuss the concept of Content Addressable Memory (CAM) and its applications. Explain how CAM differs from traditional RAM.

Problem: In Lecture 1, discuss the mapping functions used in cache memories. Explain the direct mapping technique and its advantages and limitations.

Problem: In Lecture 2, explore different mapping functions used in cache memories, such as set-associative mapping and fully associative mapping. Compare and contrast these techniques with direct mapping.
