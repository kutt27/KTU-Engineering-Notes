There are two main algorithms for multiplication of binary numbers in computer organization and architecture:

- Partial product addition and shifting
- Parallel multipliers

Partial product addition and shifting is the most common algorithm for multiplying binary numbers. It works by generating partial products for each digit in the multiplier and then adding them together. The partial products are generated by multiplying the multiplicand by each digit in the multiplier and then shifting the result one position to the left for each digit. The partial products are then added together to get the final product.

Parallel multipliers are faster than partial product addition and shifting, but they are also more complex. Parallel multipliers use a circuit to multiply the multiplicand and multiplier simultaneously. This allows them to multiply binary numbers much faster than partial product addition and shifting.

Parallel multipliers are faster than partial product addition and shifting because they can multiply binary numbers simultaneously.

Parallel multipliers are more complex than partial product addition and shifting, but they are also much faster. This makes them ideal for applications where speed is critical, such as in digital signal processing and cryptography.
